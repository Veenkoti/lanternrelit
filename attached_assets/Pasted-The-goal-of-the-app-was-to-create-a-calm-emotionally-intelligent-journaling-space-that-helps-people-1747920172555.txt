The goal of the app was to create a calm, emotionally intelligent journaling space that helps people process their thoughts and feelings in silence. It was meant to be simple but deep, with features that support healing, self-reflection, and consistency. The app allows users to write and save journal entries, with autosave functionality that kicks in after inactivity. Saved entries include metadata like mood, prompt, word count, and read time. Users can view and search through their journal history, delete entries, clear all data, download or copy their entries easily. The prompt system offers thoughtful writing cues across categories like emotional awareness, healing, mindfulness, gratitude, self-care, inspiration, and whisper prompts, while avoiding repetition. It also tracks how many prompts have been used. The background changes dynamically based on mood, using images pulled from Unsplash that match emotional tones like calm, hopeful, deep, etc. There's also a lantern mode with a soft looping video overlay, and users can choose visual themes like Nordic, Ocean, Forest, or Sunset. Mood tracking is built in, with users selecting how they feel, which is logged and visualized later for insights. The app shows rotating inspirational quotes and whisper messages to nudge the user gently. Thereâ€™s a rotating affirmation system too, with the ability to hear affirmations through speech synthesis. Users can add gratitude entries and set goals with check-off functionality. A tagging system automatically picks up keywords and hashtags from the journal text. It also tracks journal streaks and total word count, offering insights like average words per entry and mood frequency. For accessibility and extra functionality, it includes voice-to-text journaling and text-to-speech playback, with toggles for voice interaction. The app supports ARIA labels, works on both desktop and mobile, has clean responsive design, loading states, a typing indicator, and subtle UI polish for clarity and immersion. Overall, it was built to be a gentle companion for introspection, healing, and personal growth.
